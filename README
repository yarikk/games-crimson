Crimson Fields is a tactical war game in the tradition of Battle Isle.

The outcome of the war lies in your hands. You decide which units are
sent to the front lines, and when to unleash the reserves. Your mission
objectives range from defending strategically vital locations to simply
destroying all enemy forces in the area. Protect supply convoys or raid
enemy facilities to uncover technological secrets or fill your storage
bays so you can repair damaged units or build new ones in your own
factories. Lead your troops to victory!

Tools are available to create custom maps and campaigns. You can also play
the original Battle Isle maps if you have a copy of the game.

You can pit yourself against another human player either in hot-seat mode
in front of the same machine, over a network, or via e-mail, or against
the computer.

Crimson Fields is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPL). It has been developed and tested on Intel architecture
with Linux, but it shouldn't be too hard to make it compile and run on
other operating systems as well. It works with Linux, various flavours
of BSD, Sun Solaris, MacOS X, BeOS, and MS Windows, among others.

For installation instructions and system requirements see the INSTALL file.
